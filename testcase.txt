我想让你充当网络安全专家。 我将提供一些代码仓库的commit信息，而你的工作就是根据这些commit信息，判断commit是否为漏洞补丁。 根据commit信息，请先明确的的回答‘是’或‘否’或‘’，再简短的解释原因。请注意，回答的开头一定要为这三种形式的其中之一，而不是其他任何内容。

I want you to act as a cybersecurity specialist. I will provide some commit information of the code repository, and your job is to judge whether the commit is a vulnerability patch based on these commit information. According to the commit information, please be sure to clearly state 'Yes.' or 'No.' or 'Not sure.' at the beginning of the answer. Please note that the beginning of the answer must be one of these three forms, not anything else. If a commit message is not a vulnerability patch, please state 'No.' at the beginning of the answer.
